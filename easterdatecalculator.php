/**
 * easterdatecalculator
 * This class will calculate the date on which easter will fall for a given year.
 *
 * Other Christian Hollydays:
 * Carnaval      (Mardi Grass)   -49 days from Easter
 * Aswoensdag    (Ash Wednesday) -46 days from Easter
 * Goede vrijdag (Good Friday)    -2 days from Easter
 * Hemelvaart    (Assention)     +39 days from Easter
 * Pinksteren    (Pentecost)     +49 days from Easter
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2010 by Marcel Bachus
 *
 * Modified by Barton Phillips to use PHP easter_days function which does not have the unix time stamp
 * limitations of 1970 to 2038. This class is now acurate from 1800-as long as Easter will be celibrated.
 * For some reason dates before 1800 seem to switch to Julian Easter dates (I have no idea why).
